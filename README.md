# RLSDK Generator

**RLSDK Generator** is a simple light weight tool used for generating a SDK for making mods, cheats, and menus for the game Rocket League. If you would like a template to use to create a mod use my open source repo (https://github.com/imattas/rlmod-template/)

## Updating RLSDK
Make sure that when using this that you update the offsets in the 'Offsets.hpp' file. To finds the offsets you can use my offset dumper (https://github.com/imattas/rocket-league-offset-dumper)
